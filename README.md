I have contributed to the development of an e-commerce platform that specializes in selling building materials. In this platform, the admin is responsible for storing and managing resources such as categories, subcategories, and products . Users can view these resources and related products, fill their cart, and make an order upon completion.

One of the key features of this platform is the ability for users to view related products for each category or subcategory , which provides them with a more comprehensive shopping experience.

i have developed a comprehensive dashboard functioality that allows the admin to view all orders and manage them accordingly. The team is responsible for contacting users to confirm their orders and ensure that they receive the best customer service possible.
